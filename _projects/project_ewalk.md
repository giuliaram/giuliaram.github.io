## Main Description

**eWalk** is an active hip exoskeleton designed to support walking in healthy individuals. The device assists the flexionâ€“extension motion of the hips using two actuated joints, while two other passive degrees of freedom for accomodating steps width variability. This exoskeleton is designed to help to reduce fatigue and improve endurance and walking efficiency. The concept is simple: offer wearable assistance like an e-bike, but for walking.

Beyond healthy users, the device holds promise for increasing mobility and physical activity in older adults, potentially helping in maintaining an active lifestyle.

## Open Projects

We are currently exploring and open to collaboration in the following areas:

- **Machine learning for adaptive control**: personalized assistance across terrains and users
- **Sensor fusion and intention detection**: robust sensor fusion for real-time control
- **Human-subject studies**: evaluating impact on fatigue, metabolic cost, and long-term usability
- **Hardware iteration**: lighter, adjustable, and more ergonomic design
