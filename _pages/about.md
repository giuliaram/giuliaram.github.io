[IN PREPARATION]


I am a PhD student at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland, working in the REHAssist group of Dr. Mohamed Bouri, and in the Biorob laboratory of Prof. Auke Ijspeert. I work with exoskeleletons to partially assist walking, in particular with a hip wearable device developed in our group. My main research interests include biomechanics, machine learning, and gait analysis. My research is oriented towards the development and validation of individualized and adaptive control strategies for hip exoskeletons.

I am honored to be part of the MSCA doctoral network, which offers additional training in sustainability and leadership.

I was previously at the Biorobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa (Italy) for my Masters' thesis, and as a researcher after graduation. I obtained a MSc in Mechatronics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), and a BSc in Biomedical Engineering always at Politecnico di Torino.
